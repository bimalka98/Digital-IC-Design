\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Practical}
In this practical, we will be using \textit{Cadence Genus - Ver. 18.10 } to synthesize an example \ac{rtl} design, a transceiver. As inputs to Genus, we will provide

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Source Verilog files
	\item Technology libraries provided by the fabrication plant (here, $45~nm$ educational \ac{gpdk} given by Cadence) : {\tt (.lib, .lef, .tch)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Library Timing (.lib) files specify timing (cell delay, cell transition time, setup and hold time requirement) and power characteristics of standard cells. Slow and fast libraries 	characterize standard cells with maximum and minimum signal delays, which could occur from process variations.

		\item Tch files are binary files that accurately characterize library elements, that include  capacitance and resistance.
		
		\item Library Exchange Format (LEF) specify design rules, metal capacitances, layer informationâ€¦etc.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Timing constraints
\end{enumerate}

and will obtain the synthesized netlist (Verilog files) and further timing constrains {\tt (.sdc)} as output. We will then analyze the area, timing and power of the synthesized design.

\subsection{RTL Synthesis}

In the context of digital hardware design, \ac{rtl} synthesis is the process of converting an \ac{rtl} description of a digital circuit into an optimized gate-level design.\\

The \ac{rtl} description of a digital circuit is written in a \ac{hdl} such as Verilog or VHDL. It specifies the digital circuit in terms of the flow of digital signals between registers, and the logical operations that are performed on those signals as they are transferred between the registers.\\

During \ac{rtl} synthesis, an \ac{rtl} compiler reads the \ac{rtl} description of the digital circuit and generates an optimized gate-level representation of the circuit. This gate-level representation is a description of the digital circuit in terms of gates and interconnections between them. Figure \ref{fig:asic_flow} illustrates an overview of an \ac{rtl} synthesis flow.

\section{Exercise}
This section documents the observations made in step 4 and 5 of the practical guide, with screenshots and explanations.\\

\textbf{Note}: \textit{Genus is a \ac{tcl} based tool and therefore {\tt .tcl} scripts can be created to execute a series of commands instead of typing each command individually. The entire interface of Genus is accessible through \ac{tcl}, and true \ac{tcl} syntax and semantics are supported.}

\subsection{System Clocks \& Resets}

\subsubsection{System Clocks}

The specifications related to the system clocks and other constraints are defined in the {\tt constraints.tcl} script file, which can be executed once using the Genus software. The units of the clocks, and the other parameters related to timings are in nanoseconds ($ns$) scale, as defines in the Verilog source files by {\tt \`timescale 1ns/1ps}.\\

The command {\tt create\_clock}\cite{genus_command_ref_2019} is used to define the clocks, and the necessary parameters related to them. 

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
create_clock -name clk_a -period 10 [get_ports clk_a] -waveform {0 5}
create_clock -name clk_b -period 10 [get_ports clk_b] -waveform {0 5}
\end{Verbatim}

The clocks specified in the constraints file has the properties described in the Table \ref{table:clocks}. In addition to those properties, constraints related to the clock network uncertainty is also defined in the same file. In practical \ac{asic} design, ideal clock networks do not exist and clock signal arrival time may differ from cell to cell. In order to facilitate this, a parameter known as \textit{\textbf{clock uncertainty}} is defined. It takes into account all the possible variations of the clock signal such as 1. \textit{\textbf{jitter}}, which is caused by the physical properties of the clock source, and 2. \textit{\textbf{skew}}, which is due to the routing length variations.\\

The {\tt set\_clock\_uncertainty}\cite{genus_command_ref_2019} command is used to define the clock uncertainty as below.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
set_clock_uncertainty 0.5 [all_clocks]
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{table}[h]
	\captionsetup{font={sc, footnotesize}, labelsep=newline}
	\centering
	\caption{Properties of the system clocks. (time unit = $ns$)}
	\begin{tabular}{|L{0.15\linewidth}  |C{0.12\linewidth}  | C{0.12\linewidth} | C{0.12\linewidth} | C{0.12\linewidth} |} \hline
		Name & Period & Rise Time & Fall Time & Clock Uncertainty\\ \hline
		{\tt clk\_a} & 10 & 0 & 5 & 0.5\\ \hline
		{\tt clk\_b} & 10 & 0 & 5 & 0.5\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:clocks}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{System Resets}
Two system reset signals are defined in the top module {\tt uart\_top.v} Verilog source file, as {\tt reset\_a}  and {\tt reset\_b}. Both resets are synchronous and active high.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
always@(posedge clk) begin	
    if (reset) begin
      some statements;	   
    end
end
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Derived Clocks}

A \textit{derived clock} (a new clock signal) can be created from the clock waveform of a given pin in the design using the command {\tt create\_generated\_clock}\cite{genus_command_ref_2019}. Howevr, the given design for this lab does not in cooperate any derived clocks.
