\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Practical}
In this practical, we will be using \textit{Cadence Genus - Ver. 18.10 } to synthesize an example \ac{rtl} design, a \ac{uart} transceiver (shown in Figure \ref{fig:top_level}). As inputs to Genus, we will provide

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Source Verilog files
	\item Technology libraries provided by the fabrication plant (here, $45~nm$ educational \ac{gpdk} given by Cadence) : {\tt (.lib, .lef, .tch)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Library Timing (.lib) files specify timing (cell delay, cell transition time, setup and hold time requirement) and power characteristics of standard cells. Slow and fast libraries 	characterize standard cells with maximum and minimum signal delays, which could occur from process variations.

		\item Tch files are binary files that accurately characterize library elements, that include  capacitance and resistance.
		
		\item Library Exchange Format (LEF) specify design rules, metal capacitances, layer informationâ€¦etc.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Timing constraints
\end{enumerate}

and will obtain the synthesized netlist (Verilog files) and further timing constrains {\tt (.sdc)} as output. We will then analyze the area, timing and power of the synthesized design.

\subsection{RTL Synthesis}

In the context of digital hardware design, \ac{rtl} synthesis is the process of converting an \ac{rtl} description of a digital circuit into an optimized gate-level design.\\

The \ac{rtl} description of a digital circuit is written in a \ac{hdl} such as Verilog or VHDL. It specifies the digital circuit in terms of the flow of digital signals between registers, and the logical operations that are performed on those signals as they are transferred between the registers.\\

During \ac{rtl} synthesis, an \ac{rtl} compiler reads the \ac{rtl} description of the digital circuit and generates an optimized gate-level representation of the circuit. This gate-level representation is a description of the digital circuit in terms of gates and interconnections between them. Figure \ref{fig:asic_flow} illustrates an overview of an \ac{rtl} synthesis flow.

\subsection{Associated Genus Commands}

\textbf{Note}: \textit{Genus is a \ac{tcl} based tool and therefore {\tt .tcl} scripts can be created to execute a series of commands instead of typing each command individually. The entire interface of Genus is accessible through \ac{tcl}, and true \ac{tcl} syntax and semantics are supported.}\\

Followings are the commands used in this lab, and the entire script could be executed once using a single {\tt .tcl} file. However, it was encouraged to execute the commands one-by-one in order to understand the process of synthesizing an \ac{rtl} design.

\section{Exercise}
This section documents the observations made in step 4 and 5 of the practical guide, with screenshots and explanations.\\


\subsection{System Clocks \& Resets}

\subsubsection{System Clocks}

The specifications related to the system clocks and other constraints are defined in the {\tt constraints.tcl} script file, which can be executed once using the Genus software. The units of the clocks, and the other parameters related to timings are in nanoseconds ($ns$) scale, as defines in the Verilog source files by {\tt \`timescale 1ns/1ps}.\\

The command {\tt create\_clock}\cite{genus_command_ref_2019} is used to define the clocks, and the necessary parameters related to them. 

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
create_clock -name clk_a -period 10 [get_ports clk_a] -waveform {0 5}
create_clock -name clk_b -period 10 [get_ports clk_b] -waveform {0 5}
\end{Verbatim}

The clocks specified in the constraints file has the properties described in the Table \ref{table:clocks}. In addition to those properties, constraints related to the clock network uncertainty is also defined in the same file. In practical \ac{asic} design, ideal clock networks do not exist and clock signal arrival time may differ from cell to cell. In order to facilitate this, a parameter known as \textit{\textbf{clock uncertainty}} is defined. It takes into account all the possible variations of the clock signal such as 1. \textit{\textbf{jitter}}, which is caused by the physical properties of the clock source, and 2. \textit{\textbf{skew}}, which is due to the routing length variations.\\

The {\tt set\_clock\_uncertainty}\cite{genus_command_ref_2019} command is used to define the clock uncertainty as below.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
set_clock_uncertainty 0.5 [all_clocks]
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{table}[h]
	\captionsetup{font={sc, footnotesize}, labelsep=newline}
	\centering
	\caption{Properties of the system clocks. (time unit = $ns$)}
	\begin{tabular}{|L{0.15\linewidth}  |C{0.12\linewidth}  | C{0.12\linewidth} | C{0.12\linewidth} | C{0.12\linewidth} |} \hline
		Name & Period & Rise Time & Fall Time & Clock Uncertainty\\ \hline
		{\tt clk\_a} & 10 & 0 & 5 & 0.5\\ \hline
		{\tt clk\_b} & 10 & 0 & 5 & 0.5\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:clocks}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{System Resets}
Two system reset signals are defined in the top module {\tt uart\_top.v} Verilog source file, as {\tt reset\_a}  and {\tt reset\_b}. Both resets are synchronous and active high.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
always@(posedge clk) begin	
    if (reset) begin
      some statements;	   
    end
end
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Derived Clocks}

A \textit{derived clock} (a new clock signal) can be created from the clock waveform of a given pin in the design using the command {\tt create\_generated\_clock}\cite{genus_command_ref_2019}. Howevr, the given design for this lab does not in cooperate any derived clocks.

\subsection{Design Log Files}

\subsubsection{Area}

The {\tt area.log} file in the {\tt report} directory carries the information shown in the Figure \ref{fig:area_log}. It provides a breakdown of the area usage by design hierarchy and by instance, which can be helpful in identifying specific modules that are contributing to the overall area of the design. Specifically it provides the below information\cite{genus_command_ref_2019}.

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item \textbf{{Cell Count}} : The total count of cells mapped against the hierarchical blocks in the current design.
	
	\item \textbf{{Cell Area}} : The combined cell area in each of the blocks and the top level design (hierarchical breakup)
	
	\item \textbf{{Net Area}} : The estimated post-route net area, which is based on the minimum wire widths defined in the LEF and capacitance table files and the area of the design blocks.
	
	\item \textbf{{Total Area}} : Simply combines the `Cell Area' and the `Net Area'
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/area_log.PNG}
	}
	\caption{Area log file}
	\label{fig:area_log}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Power}
The {\tt power.log} file in the {\tt report} directory carries the details shown in the Figure \ref{fig:power_log}. It provides the information related to the power consumption; however, the returned information depends on the current position in the design hierarchy and on the specified objects. If no objects are specified, the report is given for the design or instance at the current position in the design hierarchy\cite{genus_command_ref_2019}.

\begin{enumerate}[i.] %re check
	\item \textbf{Leakage Power} refers to the power that is consumed by the circuit even when it is in a quiescent or standby state. This type of power consumption is caused by the leakage current flowing through the transistors and other components in the circuit.
	
	\item \textbf{Dynamic Power} refers to the power that is consumed by the circuit when it is actively switching or performing computations. This type of power consumption is caused by the charging and discharging of the load capacitance at the inputs and outputs of the transistors.
	
	\item \textbf{Total Power} is the sum of leakage power and dynamic power, it is the overall power consumed by the circuit.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/power_log.PNG}
	}
	\caption{Power log file}
	\label{fig:power_log}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Timing}
The {\tt timing.log} file in the {\tt report} directory carries the details shown in the Figure \ref{fig:timing_log}. The command given below was used to generate this timing report. `{\tt -nworst 10}' argument in the command specifies that, the maximum number of paths to report to each endpoint is 10\cite{genus_command_ref_2019}.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
report_timing  -nworst 10 > ../report/timing.log

Warning : Possible timing problems have been detected in this design. [TIM-11]
: The design is 'uart_top'.
: Use 'report timing -lint' for more information.
\end{Verbatim}

In addition, below constraints are defined in the {\tt constraints.tcl} to be used for the synthesis. Here the input delay is constrained to $6~ns = 6000~ps$, and this information is also available in the timing report shown in the Figure \ref{fig:timing_log}.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
set_input_delay  6 -clock clk_a  $design_inputs_a
set_input_delay  6 -clock clk_b  $design_inputs_b
set_output_delay 6 -clock clk_a $design_outputs_a
set_output_delay 6 -clock clk_b $design_outputs_b
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/timing_log.PNG}
	}
	\caption{Timing log file}
	\label{fig:timing_log}
\end{figure}

According to the information found on the timing log file, \textbf{the most critical path} (Path 1 in Figure \ref{fig:timing_log}) has a positive slack time of $2539~ps$.  This is the least slack time of the given design. This indicates that, there is no timing violations in the design.\\

Note: Slack is a measure of the timing margin available in a design. It is the difference between the \textit{Required Time} and the \textit{Arrival Time} of a signal at a specific endpoint. Positive slack indicates that the design meets the timing constraints and there is extra time available, while negative slack indicates that the design does not meet the timing constraints and the path is considered to be in violation. \textbf{The paths with the least slack are the most critical paths}. A design with a high slack value has more margin for manufacturing variations, temperature changes, and other factors that can affect the timing of the system.



\subsubsection{Ports}

The {\tt ports\_final.log} file in the {\tt report} directory carries the details related to the ports of the current design. By default, the report gives information on port direction, external delays, exception objects and their types, driver, slew, fanout load, pin capacitance and wire capacitance for the ports\cite{genus_command_ref_2019}. Figure \ref{fig:ports_log} illustrates the `External Delays \& Exceptions' section of the ports log file.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/ports_log.PNG}
	}
	\caption{External Delays \& Exceptions section of the ports log file}
	\label{fig:ports_log}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Changing the Top Level Designs Parameters}

In this part of the exercise, the {\tt uart\_top.v} Verilog source file was modified according to the instructions, and synthesis process was re-run. After the modification, top level design parameters will be as follows. Note that word lengths of the \ac{tx} and the \ac{rx} are changed from 8 bits to 32 bits.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
module uart_top #(
    parameter  CLOCK_IN_MHZ  =100,
    
    parameter  TX_WORD_LENGTH =32,  // # of UART-tramsmit data bits ; 6,7,8
    parameter  TX_NO_OF_WORDS =1,   // Transmitter buffer size in words.
    // Actual buffer size= TX_WORD_LENGTH * TX_NO_OF_WORDS  ; 1,2...
    '
    parameter  RX_WORD_LENGTH =32,  // # of UART-receive data bits ; 6,7,8
    parameter  RX_NO_OF_WORDS =1    // Receiver buffer size in words.
    // Actual buffer size= RX_WORD_LENGTH * RX_NO_OF_WORDS  ; 1,2.....
)
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Area Reports Comparison}

After changing the word length of the \ac{tx} and the \ac{rx}, the produced area report is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:area_log2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/area_log2.PNG}
	}
	\caption{Area log file after changing the word length of TX and RX}
	\label{fig:area_log2}
\end{figure}

When comparing the new area report with the previous area report showed in the Figure \ref{fig:area_log}, observations reported in the Table \ref{table:area_compare} can be made. Below is a summary of the most significant changes between two designs.

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\tt ins\_rx\_buffer} cell count and the total area has been increased by nearly three times. This change is predictable as the buffer size equals to {\tt RX\_WORD\_LENGTH * RX\_NO\_OF\_WORDS}, and we have increased the \ac{rx} word length by four times.
	
	\item {\tt ins\_tx\_buffer} cell count and the total area has been increased by nearly one and half times. This change is also predictable as the buffer size equals to {\tt TX\_WORD\_LENGTH * TX\_NO\_OF\_WORDS}, and we have increased the \ac{tx} word length by four times.
\end{itemize}

These increase of \ac{tx} and \ac{rx} buffer sizes have contributed to a significant area increase ($~1.5\times$) in the overall design.

\begin{table}[h]
	\captionsetup{font={sc, footnotesize}, labelsep=newline}

	\caption{Area comparison: Cell count and the Total Area}
	\begin{tabular}{|L{0.4\linewidth}  |C{0.11\linewidth}  | C{0.11\linewidth}  |C{0.11\linewidth}  | C{0.11\linewidth} |} \hline
		Instance & Cell Count 8 bit design & Cell Count 32 bit design & Total Area 8 bit design & Total Area 32 bit design\\ \hline
{\tt uart\_top} & 772 & 1128 & 3167.441 & 5117.318\\ \hline
{\tt -ins\_uart\_transceiver\_B} & 386 &  564 & 1533.792 & 2468.457\\ \hline

{\tt -----ins\_sampling\_tick\_generator} &  74 &   48 &  258.785 &  196.571\\ \hline
{\tt -----ins\_rx\_fsm} &  56 &   58 &  210.235 &  194.160\\ \hline
{\tt ---ins\_tx\_wrapper} & 189 &  259 &  703.617 &  989.896\\ \hline
{\tt -----ins\_tx\_buffer} &  94 &  146 &  313.874 &  559.655\\ \hline
{\tt -----ins\_tx\_fsm} &  53 &   66 &  198.965 &  223.690\\ \hline
{\tt -----ins\_sampling\_tick\_generator} &  42 &   47 &  178.766 &  186.234\\ \hline		
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:area_compare}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Timing Reports Comparison}

After changing the word length of the \ac{tx} and the \ac{rx}, the produced timing report is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:timing_log2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/timing_log2.PNG}
	}
	\caption{Timing log file after changing the word length of TX and RX}
	\label{fig:timing_log2}
\end{figure}

It can be observed that the least slack time which corresponds to the most critical path, has been increased to $9126~ps$. This positive slack time indicates that there is no timing violations in the given design even after the made changes. 
\pagebreak
\subsection{Changing Constraints}

In this part of the exercise, the changes were made to the {\tt constraints.tcl} file, to meet the below criteria.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item Change the system clocks of both A and B transceivers to operate at $50MHz$.
	\item Change the duty cycle of both clocks to $40\%$
	\item Introduce $180\degree$ phase shift to clock B
	\item Increase the pin load by 5pF and check the timing violations
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Changing the System Clocks}

The units of the clocks, and the other parameters related to timings are in nanoseconds ($ns$) scale, as defines in the Verilog source files by {\tt \`timescale 1ns/1ps}. Therefore in order to generate a clock operating at $50~MHz$, the clock period must be $20~ns$.  Argument `{\tt -period 20}' will do this change as follows.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
create_clock -name clk_a -period 20 [get_ports clk_a] -waveform {0 10}
create_clock -name clk_b -period 20 [get_ports clk_b] -waveform {0 10}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Changing the Duty Cycle}

Duty cycle of the clock can be changed as necessary by changing the parameters of the `{\tt -waveform}' argument. Since the clock period is $20~ns$, in order to have a $40\%$ duty cycle, clock should remain high for $8~ns$. Therefore, the rise time of the clock will be at time unit 0 and fall time will be at time unit 8.

\[
high ~time = 20~ns \times \frac{40}{100} = 8~ns
\]

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
create_clock -name clk_a -period 20 [get_ports clk_a] -waveform {0 8}
create_clock -name clk_b -period 20 [get_ports clk_b] -waveform {0 8}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Phase Shifting Clock B}

The necessary phase shift can also be given to any clock by changing the rise time and the fall time of the clock. Since we need $180\degree$ phase shift in clock B, with respect to the clock A, we need to give a shift worth half of the period to the clock B. This is equal to the rise time and fall time increment by 10 time units.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
create_clock -name clk_a -period 20 [get_ports clk_a] -waveform {0 8}
create_clock -name clk_b -period 20 [get_ports clk_b] -waveform {10 18}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Increasing Pin Loads}

Pin load is specified by the below command. Previously it was 0.2 units and in order to make it $5.2~pF$ the necessary change was made.
 
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
set_load        5.2 $design_outputs
\end{Verbatim}

\subsubsection{Timing Violations}

After making the above changes to the constraints of the design, the produced timing report is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:timing_log3}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{figures/timing_log3.PNG}
	}
	\caption{Timing log file after changing design constraints}
	\label{fig:timing_log3}
\end{figure}

It can be observed that the least slack time which corresponds to the most critical path, has been increased to $9126~ps$. This positive slack time indicates that there is no timing violations in the given design even after the made changes. An increase in slack time on the critical path means that the design has more flexibility to accommodate changes or delays without causing a timing violation.
